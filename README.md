# USC-Portfolio-Builder
Created a simple portfolio builder that gathers real-time data from Yahoo Finance

Initially created for as a project for my USC java class, this program creates a menu of options that allows users to add stocks and bonds to portfolios they can create. It gathers real time security information to build portfolios and write information out to csv to export.
